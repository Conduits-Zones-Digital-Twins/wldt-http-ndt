# SIDI - Network Digital Twin (NDT)

Network Digital Twin (NDT) allowing the dynamic and fine grained configuration and monitoring of network elements. 
They help to achieve more intelligent, efficient, safe, and full life-cycle operation and maintenance by abstracting 
the physical complexity and hiding network heterogeneity. NDTs can be associated to actual switch- es/routers as well 
as virtualized modules by following the SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) approaches, 
thus allowing their on demand creation and disposal.
